#Magnatune Download
A very simple Drag'n Drop Swing GUI to download albums from http://magnatune.com.

###Build
To build the 'magnatune.jar' the following 2 libraries must be installed.
1. /usr/share/java/log4j-1.2.jar
2. /usr/share/java/commons-httpclient.jar

Just run __ant__ from within *magnatune_downer* directory.


###Usage
Go to http://magnatune.com/genres/ and select a category.
You can now simply drop the album covers onto the Swing GUI.

All mp3s will be downloaded to ~/Music/Magnatune, and  there is a log file at ~/.magnatune.log


Enjoy the free music.
